    /**
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input:
     * gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
     * cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
     *
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Explanation:
     * Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
     * Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
     * Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
     * Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
     * Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
     * Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
     * Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
