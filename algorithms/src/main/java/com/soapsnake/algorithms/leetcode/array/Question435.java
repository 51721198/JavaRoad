     * Example 1:
     * Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.

     * Example 2:
     * Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.

     * Example 3:
     * Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
     * Output: 0
     * Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
