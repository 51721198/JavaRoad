     * Example 2:
     * Input:
     * "cccaaa"
     * Output:
     * "cccaaa"
     * Explanation:
     * Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
     * Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
     *
     *
     * Example 3:
     * Input:
     * "Aabb"
     * Output:
     * "bbAa"
     * Explanation:
     * "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
     * Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
